## Nathaniel and Evangeline Throne, the road to Wealth begins here.

### It was a misty June morning when Nathaniel Throne and his sister, Evangeline, stepped into the dust-choked garage of their late grandfather. The air smelled of mystery, like secrets long kept. They came looking for tools to fix their bike, but beneath an old leather box was far more curious: a yellowing map frazzled at the edges, ink faded but legible. Tucked beside it was a folded note. It had six words: “The road to wealth begins here.”  
### Evangeline looked up at Nathaniel eyes wide open, this is what grandfather intended when, in the twilight of his life, he looked at us and uttered find it. 

## What to do next?
